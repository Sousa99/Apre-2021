# Apre 2020 / 2021 - Machine Learning Scripts ðŸ¤–

These scripts were made with the intent of helping on the resolution of the Machine Learning course (Aprendizagem). The exam could be solved with references and scripts as help as long as the solving steps were shown and the formulas were referred.

## Word of Caution ðŸš¨

I wanted to solve the various problems that were taught in the course through Rust, but only that. So some scripts might be restricted in terms of functionality since I wanted a quick and easy script that would not take too much time in writing.

There are also some inconsistencies in terms of the way that the various parameters are inputed by the user. Some are given through the standard input with values all in one line, in various lines and some (mainly on Networks) are stipulated in the code itself since codding for the user to input would take more time. Maybe in the future I will revisit this problem.

## Possible Improvements ðŸ”®

1. Standardize the way the input is given by the user.
2. Networkds should be defined dynamically by user input, instead of statically referenced in code.
3. Increase the dimensionality of problems were images are exported.
